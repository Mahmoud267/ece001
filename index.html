            The main concept of a network of smart devices was discussed as early as 1982, with a modified Coca-Cola
            vending machine at Carnegie Mellon University becoming the first ARPANET-connected appliance,
            able to report its inventory and whether newly loaded drinks were cold or not.
            Mark Weiser's 1991 paper on ubiquitous computing, "The Computer of the 21st Century", as well as academic
            venues such as UbiComp and PerCom produced the contemporary vision of the IOT.
            The concept of the "Internet of Things" and the term itself, first appeared in a speech by Peter T. Lewis,
            to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation 15th Annual Legislative Weekend in Washington, D.C, published
            in September 1985.<br>
            There are a number of serious concerns about dangers in the growth of the IoT, especially in the areas of
            privacy and security, and consequently industry and governmental moves to address these concerns have begun
            including the development of international standards.<br>

            The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is an application of the IoT for medical and health related purposes,
            data collection and analysis for research, and monitoring.[38][39][40][41][42] The IoMT has been referenced
            as "Smart Healthcare",[43] as the technology for creating a digitized healthcare system, connecting
            available medical resources and healthcare services.
            IoT devices can be used to enable remote health monitoring and emergency notification systems. These health
            monitoring devices can range from blood pressure and heart rate monitors to advanced devices capable of
            monitoring specialized implants, such as pacemakers, Fitbit electronic wristbands, or advanced hearing
            aids.[46] Some hospitals have begun implementing "smart beds" that can detect when they are occupied and
            when a patient is attempting to get up. It can also adjust itself to ensure appropriate pressure and support
            is applied to the patient without the manual interaction of nurses.[38] A 2015 Goldman Sachs report
            indicated that healthcare IoT devices "can save the United States more than $300 billion in annual
            healthcare expenditures by increasing revenue and decreasing cost."[47] Moreover, the use of mobile devices
            to support medical follow-up led to the creation of 'm-health', used analyzed health statistics."
            Specialized sensors can also be equipped within living spaces to monitor the health and general well-being
            of senior citizens, while also ensuring that proper treatment is being administered and assisting people
            regain lost mobility via therapy as well.[49] These sensors create a network of intelligent sensors that are
            able to collect, process, transfer, and analyze valuable information in different environments, such as
            connecting in-home monitoring devices to hospital-based systems.[43] Other consumer devices to encourage
            healthy living, such as connected scales or wearable heart monitors, are also a possibility with the
            IoT.[50] End-to-end health monitoring IoT platforms are also available for antenatal and chronic patients,
            helping one manage health vitals and recurring medication requirements.

            The IoT's major significant trend in recent years is the explosive growth of devices connected and
            controlled by the Internet.[104] The wide range of applications for IoT technology mean that the specifics
            can be very different from one device to the next but there are basic characteristics shared by most.<br>
            The IoT creates opportunities for more direct integration of the physical world into computer-based systems,
            resulting in efficiency improvements, economic benefits, and reduced human exertions<br>
            The number of IoT devices increased 31% year-over-year to 8.4 billion in the year 2017[109] and it is
            estimated that there will be 30 billion devices by 2020.[104] The global market value of the IoT is
            projected to reach $7.1 trillion by 2020.<br>
            Ambient intelligence and autonomous control are not part of the original concept of the Internet of things.
            Ambient intelligence and autonomous control do not necessarily require Internet structures, either. However,
            there is a shift in research (by companies such as Intel) to integrate the concepts of the IoT and
            autonomous control, with initial outcomes towards this direction considering objects as the driving force
            for autonomous IoT.[111] A promising approach in this context is deep reinforcement learning where most of
            IoT systems provide a dynamic and interactive environment.[112] Training an agent (i.e., IoT device) to
            behave smartly in such an environment cannot be addressed by conventional machine learning algorithms such
            as supervised learning. By reinforcement learning approach, a learning agent can sense the environment's
            state (e.g., sensing home temperature), perform actions (e.g., turn HVAC on or off) and learn through the
            maximizing accumulated rewards it receives in long term.<br>
            IoT intelligence can be offered at three levels: IoT devices, Edge/Fog nodes, and Cloud computing.[113] The
            need for intelligent control and decision at each level depends on the time sensitiveness of the IoT
            application. For example, an autonomous vehicle's camera needs to make real-time obstacle detection to avoid
            an accident. This fast decision making would not be possible through transferring data from the vehicle to
            cloud instances and return the predictions back to the vehicle. Instead, all the operation should be
            performed locally in the vehicle. Integrating advanced machine learning algorithms including deep learning
            into IoT devices is an active research area to make smart objects closer to reality. Moreover, it is
            possible to get the most value out of IoT deployments through analyzing IoT data, extracting hidden
            information, and predicting control decisions. A wide variety of machine learning techniques have been used
            in IoT domain ranging from traditional methods such as regression, support vector machine, and random forest
            to advanced ones such as convolutional neural networks, LSTM, and variational autoencoder<br>
            In the future, the Internet of Things may be a non-deterministic and open network in which auto-organized or
            intelligent entities (web services, SOA components) and virtual objects (avatars) will be interoperable and
            able to act independently (pursuing their own objectives or shared ones) depending on the context,
            circumstances or environments. Autonomous behavior through the collection and reasoning of context
            information as well as the object's ability to detect changes in the environment (faults affecting sensors)
            and introduce suitable mitigation measures constitutes a major research trend,[115] clearly needed to
            provide credibility to the IoT technology. Modern IoT products and solutions in the marketplace use a
            variety of different technologies to support such context-aware automation, but more sophisticated forms of
            intelligence are requested to permit sensor units and intelligent cyber-physical systems to be deployed in
            real environments.<br>

    <div id="Enabling technologies">
        The original idea of the Auto-ID Center is based on RFID-tags and distinct identification through the Electronic
        Product Code. This has evolved into objects having an IP address or URI.[138] An alternative view, from the
        world of the Semantic Web[139] focuses instead on making all things (not just those electronic, smart, or
        RFID-enabled) addressable by the existing naming protocols, such as URI. The objects themselves do not converse,
        but they may now be referred to by other agents, such as powerful centralised servers acting for their human
        owners.
        the limited address space of IPv4 (which allows for 4.3 billion different addresses), objects in the IoT will
        have to use the next generation of the Internet protocol (IPv6) to scale to the extremely large address space
        required.
        Internet-of-things devices additionally will benefit from the stateless address auto-configuration present in
        IPv6,[144] as it reduces the configuration overhead on the hosts,
        and the IETF 6LoWPAN header compression. To a large extent, the future of the Internet of things will not be
        possible without the support of IPv6; and consequently, the global adoption of IPv6 in the coming years will be
        critical for the successful development of the IoT in the future.
